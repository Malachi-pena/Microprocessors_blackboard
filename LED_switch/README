##Project Overview##

  This project contains C source code developed for use with the Blackboard Development Kit. 
The program demonstrates fundamental embedded systems programming concepts, including GPIO 
control, peripheral communication, and hardware interaction. It is designed as a learning 
resource to explore how C code interfaces with the Blackboardâ€™s hardware features.

##The code can be used to:##

- Initialize and configure hardware peripherals.

- Control input/output pins and external components.

- Serve as a template for experimenting with embedded applications.
