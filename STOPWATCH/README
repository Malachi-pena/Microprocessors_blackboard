## STOPWATCH ##
This project implements a simple stopwatch on the BlackBoard Development kit using C.
The program interacts directly with memory-mapped I/O registers to control a 7-segment
display and read input from buttons on the board.

## Functionality ##
- Start counting (BT1).
- Stop count (BT0). 
- Reset to zero (BT2, only when stopped). 
- Digits are displayed in BCD format on the 7- segment display.

## Features##
- Automatic display refresh in 100 ms increamts.
- simple modular C functions ( display_BCD, handle_buttons, stopwatch_mode).
- Reset includes a short 200 ms debounce deplay to avoid multiple resets.
