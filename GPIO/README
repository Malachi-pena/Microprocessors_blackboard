The following code demostrates interfacing with hardware peripherals through memory-mapped registers via a system built on FPGA.
the code corresponds to several LED indicators, switches,and PMOD ports

## Features 
- Reads input from physical switches and buttons. 
- Displays switch states on hardware peripherals on board.
- Shows how to send signals through PMOD connectors. 
- Includes timing control using delays i.e "sleep" function. 

---

## Repository Structure
- ** GPIO.c** main program source code.
- Defines memory- mapped register addresses
- Implements GPIO input reading and output control

--

## Requirements 
- C compiler ( e.g., Gcc or Xilinx SDK tools, depending on individual)
- Target hardware that supports the given memory- mapped register addresses 
- register addresses could be found on the blackboard real digital reference manual under GPIO's
